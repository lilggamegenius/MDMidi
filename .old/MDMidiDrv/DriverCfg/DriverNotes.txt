Settings are saved to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\MD MIDI Driver.
If the MIDI driver can't find a key in HKEY_CURRENT_USER, it will look in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.

These settings are available:

Name		| Type		| Description/Notes
----------------+---------------+---------------
Volume		| REG_DWORD	| 10000 = 100%
BufNum		| REG_DWORD	| Number of Buffers (WinMM/DSound)
XBufNum		| REG_DWORD	| Number of Buffers (XAudio2)
BufSmpls	| REG_DWORD	| Samples per Buffer
		|		|   > 0 - BufSmpls (can be 10..1024)
		|		|   = 0 - auto (SampleRate / 250)
		|		|   < 0 - (SampleRate / -BufSmpls)
SampleRate	| REG_DWORD	| Output Sample Rate
SoundAPIDisable	| REG_DWORD	| Bitmask to disable Sound APIs

When installing the driver, a new key called "midi1"* with the DLL path as value is created in
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Drivers32 [Win32 or Win64 for x64 programs]
or
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Drivers32 [Win64 for x32 programs]

* The number may be higher, if you already installed another MIDI driver like the BASSMIDI Driver by kode54 and Mudlord.
